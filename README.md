# distributed-s3-file-upload
Author: Adham Popal

# Objective
To create a system that can read in huge files and upload to an amazon s3 bucket and demostrate with some other cloud service. The goal beyond that is to target fault tolerance, in which a real program needs to ensure that in the event of failure, a potentially important file can still be reliably uploaded to the cloud.
